#Weak Ends

Sunday. Since forever, it has been that song I've always wanted to listen to. To soak in the slow strumming in the intro. To sway my head to the upbeat chorus when they play it the first time. And to finally get the dead flame within to resurrect itself and flicker like an visual metronome. Truth be told, as fancy and exciting as it sounds, never even once have the plans passed toward execution. A pretty proof of concept that rests on paper (or a pdf if you insist on going digital). Before I can get my lazy self to even start doing everything I've been procrastinating for a literal eternity, the day ends and so does the sacred weekend. I half-heartedly put on the stuffy shoes they call Monday dreading every instance of the base class embarrassment that will definitely be declared each day. Showers of remorse and guilt wipe my mind clean of the dirt that false hope supposedly is. But the lazy mind will carefully find that secret tunnel (ironically so) and chart out a journey through another week of mediocrity. Drudgery is bearable when one is secretly content with the mundane existence devoid of meaning. That's a depressing way to put it. Maybe I need to stop writing now. The alarm that obligation is calls me. The aircraft has landed. The dream is over. The stereo switches to the next song, another's favourite. Maybe they'll play another one of my favourites soon. And I'll be awake to listen to it.
