Nobody really likes to wait. Time sure is precious but the hatred and possible repulsiveness that waiting finds itself greeted by does not owe itself to that. Patiently waiting is at best an oxymoron that rarely finds a non hypothetical example in the fast moving world we think we live in. Pacing up and down corridoors when appointments at the dentist get scheduled (with the speed inversely proportional to how bad your toothache is); fixating wide twinkling eyes at the gate when it's time for mommy to come back home; sighing and scrolling through feeds because "you weren't there on time"; grunting and switching tabs when the model takes too long to train. Doubtless it is that waiting induces remorse, anger and frustration at different levels. Waiting for that point in spacetime when uncertainty takes its leave, but not for good though. Funny thing time is with its perception by the restless mind. A waiting mind.
