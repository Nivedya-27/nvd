## Some stuff

Hi there! This is a collection of seemingly unrelated thoughts knit into a webpage by lazy fingers coerced by a mind that is attempting to seek salvation in writing. Joblessness (if there ever was a word like that) and boredom find their limits being stretched at space-time coordinates that would suggest a life devoid of these. They were right, it's all about perception - those short sighted along dimensions that the mind mustn't be find themselves bingeing on the perfect trio that boredom, confusion and loneliness make up. However dull things may seem, and however toxic some thoughts nag the so-called fragile construct within, a little exercise of the metacarpophalangeal joints (probably [that's](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17052825/) what I mean) proves a worthwhile meditation that brings, or at least sends a formal invitation to, the celebrated feeling that joy is. Pointless conversations never felt this prudent to yours truly. See you on this very side and a few others too.
