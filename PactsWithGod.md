Sometimes I tend to require impossible things to happen. Mostly a lot of them at once. Things beyond my control and many beyond my capacity. That's when I look up to the skies and hope for the clouds to drift a little and brighten things up. I pray. Praying is a good sign though. It shows your eagerness to live a little longer to see good things happen. But I'm the kind God (if there really is one) might attend to last. Well aware of this, I make deals. Pacts with God. I'll keep my eyes open for 1 minute straight so you can make those ridiculous things work, God. Stupid. But it keeps me going. It's my way of putting up with life when it's giving me lemons and I'm definitely not in the mood for a lemonade. Slowly, logic seeps through that rusted brain of mine and I see there was no hope and I wasn't doing anything of value. And as much as I'd rather not be alive when I see things getting worse, life drags me forward and most definitely under. The new normals make their peace and I brush the misery under my cranky bed. I smile and I say hello how do you do, my friend.
