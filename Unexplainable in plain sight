Life presents unexplainable mysteries. No, I’m not talking about alien sightings and zombie invasions. Neither am I talking about probability lessons (though they can indeed be unexplainable at times). I’m alluding to something so fundamental to human existence – a driving force behind human actions at all ages – friendship. Building bonds that grow stronger with time. No scope for attenuation.
But getting it right is more difficult than it sounds. Conscious attempts to strengthen bonds seemingly have the opposite impact. Everything has to be implicit. Hidden. Magical. Naturally it comes to the gifted few whilst some try and fail every time. Which side to belong to is perhaps not a choice entirely, but an assignment that circumstance makes. Or so one thinks.
As one watches the world through a lens constantly changing its power with experiences good, bad and ugly, one is at times myopic, failing to see what little things today could mean years from now and sometimes even tomorrow. But some lucky myopes are gifted glasses by kind far-sighted individuals. And some of these lucky myopes are stupid enough not to wear them. Or maybe the glasses weren’t the right size.
Regardless, friendship remains unexplainable. Equations and theories are powerful sure but can they capture friendship with all its exceptions? Maybe friendship and human relations are the holy grail that nothing and nobody can fully understand, destined to be implicit, hidden and magical.
